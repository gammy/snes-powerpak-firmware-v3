This theme is is based on the simba and mufasa themes by ManuLÃ¶we.
New ABXY/UDLR/Cursor icons and palette are by me, gammy.

The amazing cartridge and controller art were made by my friend Frost:

As I write this CREDITS file in February 2021, three or so years of building
this .THM-file, I regretfully cannot find the original source material.
I thought I had added this stuff to the git repo *years* ago, but apparently
I was mistaken. I'll add them if I find them, but for now, you only get the 
.THM. If you reuse this artwork, please contact Frost first.
