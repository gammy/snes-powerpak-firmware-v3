These are some scripts, originally based on Ramsis' batch files.
As I work on linux, I've made these tools for that purpose.
It's all been cobbled together quite quickly: sorry if this is confusing!

I suppose this should all work fine on mingw/cygwin/BSD as well, as long as
- you run these scripts from within this path (e.g where this file lies)
- you have the base dependencies: git, bash, gcc, g++, cmake, make, head, awk.
